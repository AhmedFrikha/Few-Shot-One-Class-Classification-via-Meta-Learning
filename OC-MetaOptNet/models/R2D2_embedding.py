# Embedding network used in Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers
# (Bertinetto et al., in submission to NIPS 2018).
# They call the ridge rigressor version as "Ridge Regression Differentiable Discriminator (R2D2)."
  
# Note that they use a peculiar ordering of functions, namely conv-BN-pooling-lrelu,
# as opposed to the conventional one (conv-BN-lrelu-pooling).
